#Trees, Bagging, Random Forest and Boosting
####• Classification Trees
####• Bagging: Averaging Trees
####• Random Forests: Cleverer Averaging of Trees
####• Boosting: Cleverest Averaging of Trees

Methods for improving the performance of weak learners such as Trees. Classification trees are adaptive and robust, but do not generalize well. 

#Properties of Trees

####✔ Can handle huge datasets
####✔ Can handle mixed predictors—quantitative and qualitative
####✔ Easily ignore redundant variables
####✔ Handle missing data elegantly
####✔ Small trees are easy to interpret
####✖ large trees are hard to interpret
####✖ Often prediction performance is poor
